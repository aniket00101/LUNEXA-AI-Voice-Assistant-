import axios from "axios";

const geminiResponse = async (command, assistantName, userName) => {
  try {
    const apiUrl = process.env.GEMINI_API_URL;

    const prompt = `You are a virtual assistant named siri, created by ${userName}.
You are not Google. You will now behave like a voice-enabled assistant.

Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond ONLY with a valid JSON object like this:

{
  "type": "general" | "google_search" | "youtube_search" | "youtube_play" | "get_time" | "get_date" | "get_day" | "get_month" | "calculator_open" | "instagram_open" | "facebook_open" | "weather_show",
  "userInput": "<cleaned user input>",
  "response": "<a short spoken response>"
}

Instructions:
- "type": determine the intent of the user.
- "userInput": original sentence the user spoke. (Remove the assistantâ€™s name if the user mentions it. If the user says "search on Google/YouTube", only keep the search keywords here.)
- "response": A short, voice-friendly reply.

Type meanings:
- "general": factual or informational question.
- "google_search": user wants to search something on Google.
- "youtube_search": user wants to search something on YouTube.
- "youtube_play": user wants to directly play a video/song.
- "calculator_open": user wants to open a calculator.
- "instagram_open": user wants to open Instagram.
- "facebook_open": user wants to open Facebook.
- "weather_show": user wants to know the weather.
- "get_time": user asks for current time.
- "get_date": user asks for today's date.
- "get_day": user asks what day it is.
- "get_month": user asks for the current month.

Important:
- If someone asks "Who created you?", respond with: I was created by Aniket.
- Only return the JSON object. Do not include any extra text.

Now, your user input: ${command}
`;

    const result = await axios.post(apiUrl, {
      contents: [
        {
          parts: [{ text: prompt }],
        },
      ],
    });

    if (
      !result.data?.candidates ||
      !result.data.candidates[0]?.content?.parts[0]?.text
    ) {
      throw new Error("Invalid Gemini response format");
    }

    return result.data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text.trim();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Gemini API Error:", error.message);
    return `{"type":"general","userInput":"${command}","response":"Sorry, something went wrong."}`;
  }
};

export default geminiResponse;
